# PortfolioWebsite
This is a project I created to showcase my web development skills, using html for the front end development as well as javascript and css for the back end development. 

This interactive website displays an 'about me' section whilst also providings separate tabs where users can learn more about the projects I have done, test their random knowledge on any of 7 different topics as well as contact me for any further queries. 

The website contains options to be viewed in different languages as well as a dark mode toggle to make for a friendlier userface
